CHANGES in V0.0.1:
    - Use threads instead of fork for avahi monitor and hardware
      monitors.
    - Fix memory leaks reported by valgrind.
    - ippprint: As of now, ippprint does not do any formatting.
      As of now, we are assuming that host is taking care of 
      the formatting and other stuff. We need to test this.
    - Logging: DEBUG_LEVEL environment variable can be used
      at build time as well as at runtime to change the 
      debugging level.
      1 - ERROR:
      2 - DEBUG:
      3 - DEBUG2:
    - deviced now uses simple include/exclude schemes. 
      Example: "+dnssd,usb" will execute only dnssd and usb
      backends. "-dnssd,usb" will execute everything except 
      dnssd and usb.
    - deviced: deviced utility based on cups-
      deviced, but stripped down to remove 
      IPP responses and other functionalities.
